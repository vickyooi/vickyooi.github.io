            <p class="video-description"><b>SPRING IN EUROPE</b> During the Spring of 2018, I had the opportunity to study abroad in London for 
                three months. While I was there, I decided to film some of the places around London, as well as the 
                countries I visited in Europe. I wanted my film to convey a strong and nostalgic feeling, therefore I’ve 
                set the color tone to appear washed out and chose the song, “Mystery of Love” by Sufjan Stevens as I 
                felt it reflected these feelings the most.</p>

            <p class="video-description"><b>ASCEND UC DAVIS</b> A video I created to promote Ascend UC Davis, a chapter of a national business 
              organization in North America. The video showcases events that Ascend UC Davis have hosted and 
              attended, including events with guest speakers from E. & J. Gallo, Edelman Digital, and FDIC. I created 
              the title transitions using Adobe After Effect and edited using Adobe Premiere. </p>

            <p class="video-description"><b>BUTTON</b> This animation was the first rotoscoping animation I made using Adobe Animate. It was 
              inspired by my nine-year-old bunny name Button. My inspiration for this video came when I was 
              watching a video of Button hopping and realized how agile and detailed a rabbit’s action is.  </p>

            <p class="video-description"><b>METABALLS</b> For this animation, I was inspired by the way cells pull apart from each other. The goal 
              of this project was to match an action to a song and after deciding upon mimicking a cell division, I 
              conveniently chose a song called “Gooey” because the balls resembled goo. Through camera works 
              and color choices, I was able to pair the music and animation together to create a simple, but 
              appealing piece.  </p>

            <p class="video-description"><b>ORANGES AS STOCKING STUFFERS</b> The first video I created for Spoon University, a nationwide 
              online food blog. “Oranges as Stocking Stuffers” explains the reasoning behind the tradition of putting 
              oranges in Christmas Stockings. It was published on the official Spoon University social medias, gaining 
              almost 100,000 views and over 100 comments on Facebook and Instagram combined. This video style
              is created in a way to emphasize the information through big, bold text and gif/pictures that matches 
              the current text on-screen. I edited this video using Adobe Premiere. </p>
