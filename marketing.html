            <b>MARKETING AT SACHACK</b> SacHack is Sacramento’s first intercollegiate hackathon developed by a team of
            students from UC Davis and Sacramento State University. The first event took place in McClellan Conference 
            Center in Sacramento on November 2018. The event was co-hosted by the Sacramento Kings as a way to promote 
            innovations and new data solutions in the Sacramento area. As the Director of Marketing for SacHacks, my 
            task was to gain interest within colleges and universities across America and spread the word of the event.</p>
           <p class ="marketing-description">
            With SacHacks being a new hackathon, my team and I needed to start from scratch and utilize social media to 
            reach a greater audience. In order to promote SacHacks, I have contacted computer science, design, and game 
            development departments in most of the community colleges and universities in California and create 
            partnerships with established hackathon communities. Our outreach strategy soon capture the attention of 
            not just colleges across the United States but other countries as well, including India and Canada. Within 
            three months, the number of registrations more than tripled from thirty applicants to over a thousand.</p>

            <b>MARKETING AT ASCEND UC DAVIS</b> Ascend is the largest, non-profit Pan-Asian organization for 
            business professionals in North America. Ascend UC Davis is a college chapter of this 
            organization. We provide opportunities for students to expand their network, gain business 
            skills, and learn from professionals. </p>
            
            <p class="marketing-description">
            I joined Ascend UC Davis during the fall of 2017, hoping to learn more about business and 
            marketing. As a Cinema and Digital Media major, I was looking to combine my experience in 
            film and digital art to market a product through media. I soon joined the marketing team 
            as a Marketing Committee member. </p>

            <p class="marketing-description">
            As a Marketing Committee member, I created Ascend’s first major promotional video. This 
            video features guest speakers, socials, and general meetings. The idea behind the creation 
            of this video was to engage our audience in a visually appealing way and to show all the 
            benefits that Ascend has to offer. Additionally, I photographed Ascend meetings and events 
            for social media and raised awareness of our organization through classroom announcements 
            and tabling on campus. </p>

            <p class="marketing-description">
            As of June 2018, I became the Vice President of Marketing at Ascend UC Davis. As the 
            marketing officer, I manage Ascend’s Facebook page and Instagram account. I continually 
            promote events on Facebook in order to keep our members updated on different opportunities 
            and events. Additionally, I post weekly on Ascend’s Instagram in order to increase our 
            exposure to the public and create a greater interest within our community. I also create 
            flyers and Facebook events for upcoming affairs. </p>
